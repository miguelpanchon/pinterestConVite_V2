## Functionality:
-Possibility of consuming images from unsplash (either random or filtering by keywords) in a deployed website
-When clicking on the logo (MP) the text box is emptied and a new random search is performed
-Responsive design + media queries to adapt the layout and content to different display widths
-when clicking on a picture there is a link to the picture and a new website is opened


## Technical challenges:
### General
```sh

Format readme files
Understand endpoints of an API
Usage of Async functions and API consumtion
Initial usage of components
Vite as a front en dev tool with vanilla JavaScript 
Usage of Github as a repository
Deployment: Netlify/Vercel



### JS

- variables
- general formatting


### Optional (not implemented currently) 

-debouncing: introduction of text waiting a bit so that the JS code does not perform several lookups using the API.
